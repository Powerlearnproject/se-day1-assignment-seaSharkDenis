Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development, and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Software engineering helps in the following ways:
1. Solving real world problems through technology.
2. Identifying issues through quality assurance, ensuring that only systems that have met the required standards are published for use by users.
3. Bringing people together through development of solutions such as whatsapp, instagram, or even slack. This ensures family, friends or even people in organizations can get in touch with each other even when they are far from each other, ensuring prompt connection.
4. Bringing entertainment to the palm of your hands through relaying of items such as games, sports through various channels.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages - This saw the introduction of programming languages such as FORTRAN(Formula Translator), C, LISP e.t.c, which influenced the development of other programming languages such as Java.
2. Era of agile methodoloies - The era of agile methodologies in the early 2000s, which emphasized on flexibility, customer involvement, and rapid iteration, improvong the process of software engineering.
3. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline - This was established around the 1960s, due to the need for structured methodologies to manage complexity and improve quality.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - This phase involves collecting data from users and also requirements needed for the devlopment of a system.
2. Design - This involved the creation of designs of how the system will look like.
3. Implementation - This phase involves the actual creation of the system according to the user requirements.
4. Testing - This involves conducting various testing types to the software ensuring that it meets the criteria specified and functions as expected.
5. Deployment - This involves releasing the software to the end user.
6. Maintenance - This involves supporting the users, publishing updates and maintaining the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
While the waterfall methodology is sequential, with each phase being carried out once, the agile methodology is iterative and incremental. A phase can be conducted multiple times, with each iteration being dictated by feedback provided at each phase.
A waterfall metholody can be used where the software requirements are well defined, or project has fixed budget and timelines.
An agile methodology, on the other hand, can be used in areas where feedback is being received to make changes, the project is under a collaborative environment where various stakeholders are providing feedback, or the requirments may keep on changing.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer - Their work is writing code and implementing solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer - Their work is ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project Manager - The project manager is responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. An Integrated Development Environment provides comprehensive tools in one place for writing, debugging and tesing code. An example is  Visual Studio Code.
2. A Version Control System is a platform that helps tracking changes made to source code and providing collaboration among team members. An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements - A project's requirements may change during its development phase, resulting in delays in the project shipping date.
2. Tight deadlines - Tight deadlines scheduled for project can bring about rushed development of a software, and results to rushed development and compromised quality of the software.
3. Technical debt - This can be as a result of developing sub-optimal solutions for a software which can lead to a higher maintenance cost of the software in the future.

Strategies that can be put in place to overcome these challenges include:
1. Properly definig requirements through effective communication.
2. Prioritization of tasks.
3. Agile methodologies.
4. Regular assessments of projects goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing - This is the process of testing individual unit of a software.
2. Integration testing - This is the process of testing interactions of different subsystems or components.
3. System tesing - This refers to testing the system as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing - This is testing the system against the user requirements to ensure that it meets the user needs.
The importance of software quality assurance is to ensure the defects are identified early in the software development, leading to high quality software product being shippped.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions to get the best responses from AI models. The importance of this is:
1. To clear confusions.
2. Helping the model know what you exactly what you need.
3. Getting best responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt
"Write about phones"

Improved prompt
"Write a concise comparison of the latest iPhone and Samsung Galaxy models, focusing on their camera features, battery life, and user interface."

Why the improved prompt is more effective
1. Specific Topic: The improved prompt specifies exactly what aspect of phones to focus onâ€”camera features, battery life, and user interface. This clarity helps the model avoid unnecessary information.
2. Clear Objective: By asking for a comparison, the prompt clearly states the objective of the writing. This ensures that the model knows what it is trying to achieve, which is to compare and contrast these specific models.
3. Concise Output: Requesting a concise comparison encourages the model to be efficient with their words, ensuring that the content is direct and to the point.
4. Relevant Details: Mentioning specific phone models (iPhone and Samsung Galaxy) provides context and relevance. This helps the AI model understand the user's interests and tailor the content accordingly.
5. Measurable Outcomes: The prompt allows for measurable outcomes, such as comparing specific features like camera quality or battery life. This makes it easier to evaluate the effectiveness of the comparison.
